The Problem
Edge AI is transforming industries:
automotive, and industrial automation.

smart

cities,

• Single points of failure

Devices rely on frequent firmware and AI model updates,
which, if compromised, can pose serious safety, privacy,
and security risks.
Current
update
infrastructures:

systems

rely

on

These systems face several limitations:

centralized

Cloud-based OTA (Over-The-Air) update platforms
PKI-based certificate authorities

• Expensive to operate and hard to scale across millions
of devices
• Limited transparency, traceability, and no native
rollback support
• Modern SoCs already feature cryptographic engines,
secure enclaves, and secure boot—but these are not
fully leveraged for decentralized trust.

We propose a decentralized update validation system that moves trust
from the cloud into the SoC itself.
Each AI-enabled SoC integrates a lightweight blockchain client (e.g.,
NanoChain or Tendermint-Lite) along with its secure enclave and
cryptographic accelerators.
• Manufacturer publishes firmware/model hashes on a permissioned
blockchain ledger.
• Devices fetch updates and verify them locally using on-chip SHA/ECC
engines.
• Updates are installed only after consensus is reached across validator
nodes.
• This eliminates dependence on a single server or CA.
• Provides immutable audit trails, secure rollbacks, and self-healing
peer-to-peer recovery mechanisms.

Our Solution?
A BlockchainSecured, SiliconEmbedded Trust
Fabric

Technical
Novelty
What sets our system apart:
• Silicon-Level Consensus:
• Unlike edge/cloud blockchains, our design embeds consensus logic into SoC firmware and secure hardware.
• Resource-Aware Protocols:
Custom blockchain protocols optimized for low-power, area-constrained silicon
• Self-Healing Peer Network:
When nodes are compromised or go offline, neighboring devices facilitate update propagation and rollback
• MVP Demonstration Ready:
A functional private blockchain testnet runs on Raspberry Pis, simulating SoC behavior
• Demos include: secure model updates, rejection of malicious binaries, and full rollback

Business Model Revenue Streams
We offer a subscription-based security service for OEMs and
IoT solution providers.
• Per-device subscription:
• $1–$3 USD per device, per year
• Provides access to the blockchain network, consensus
engine, and recovery services
• This model is ideal for scaling across millions of devices in
distributed environments such as:
• Smart meters, autonomous drones, industrial sensors,
and more

Customer Benefits:
• No need to maintain secure cloud
infrastructure
• Verifiable, tamper-proof update
trails
• Seamless compliance with security
regulations
• Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)
than traditional OTA security
models
